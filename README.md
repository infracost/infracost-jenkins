# Infracost Jenkins

This project provides instructions for using Infracost in a Jenkins pipeline. This enables you to see cloud cost estimates for Terraform in pull requests. ðŸ’°

## Quick start


1. Create a new credential in Jenkins' management panel, called `jenkins-infracost-api-key`, and enter your Infracost API key. To get an API key [download Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start) and run `infracost register`.

2. Create a new file at `Jenkinsfile` in your repo with the following content and update it to match your environment.

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('infracost') {
            agent {
                docker {
                    // Always use the latest 0.10.x version to pick up bug fixes and new resources.
                    // See https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/cicd/#docker-images for other options
                    image 'infracost/infracost:ci-0.10'
                    args "--user=root --entrypoint=''"
                }
            }

            // Set up any required credentials for posting the comment, e.g. GitHub token, GitLab token
            environment {
                INFRACOST_API_KEY = credentials('jenkins-infracost-api-key')
            }

            steps {
                // Clone the base branch of the pull request (e.g. main/master) into a temp directory.
                sh 'git clone $GIT_URL --branch=$CHANGE_TARGET --single-branch /tmp/base'

                // Generate Infracost JSON file as the baseline, add any required sub-directories to path, e.g. `/tmp/base/PATH/TO/TERRAFORM/CODE`.
                sh 'infracost breakdown --path=/tmp/base \
                                        --format=json \
                                        --out-file=/tmp/infracost-base.json'

                // Generate an Infracost diff and save it to a JSON file.
                sh 'infracost diff --path=PATH/TO/TERRAFORM/CODE \
                                   --format=json \
                                   --compare-to=/tmp/infracost-base.json \
                                   --out-file=/tmp/infracost.json'

                // Posts a comment to the PR using the 'update' behavior.
                // This creates a single comment and updates it. The "quietest" option.
                // The other valid behaviors are:
                //   delete-and-new - Delete previous comments and create a new one.
                //   hide-and-new - Minimize previous comments and create a new one.
                //   new - Create a new cost estimate comment on every push.
                // See https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cli_commands/#comment-on-pull-requests for other options.
                sh 'infracost comment github --path=/tmp/infracost.json \
                                             --repo=$GITHUB_REPO \
                                             --pull-request=$GITHUB_PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER \
                                             --github-token=$GITHUB_TOKEN \
                                             --behavior=update'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3. ðŸŽ‰ That's it! Send a new pull request to change something in Terraform that costs money. You should see a merge request comment that gets updated, e.g. the ðŸ“‰ and ðŸ“ˆ emojis will update as changes are pushed! Check the build Console Output and [this page](https://www.infracost.io/docs/troubleshooting/) if there are issues.

4. Follow [the docs](https://www.infracost.io/usage-file) if you'd also like to show cost for of usage-based resources such as AWS Lambda or S3. The usage for these resources are fetched from CloudWatch/cloud APIs and used to calculate an estimate.

## Comment options

The Infracost CLI can post cost estimates to pull request or commits on GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos and Bitbucket. Run `infracost comment --help` to see the the list of options or [see our docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cli_commands/#comment-on-pull-requests).

If you're using another source control system, you can use the [`infracost output --format github-comment`](https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cli_commands/#combined-output-formats) command to generate a markdown file and post that to your source control system using `curl`.

## Examples

We don't yet have examples for different use cases with Infracost for Jenkins, but we do have a selection of [examples for GitLab](https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci/-/tree/master/examples#examples) that can be modified to work with Jenkins.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please create issues in [this repo](https://github.com/infracost/infracost) or [join our community Slack](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we are a friendly bunch and happy to help you get started :)
